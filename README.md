# 32-point-Radix-2FFT
This is a 32 point pipelined Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) design used in OFDM system. 
The design is based on Radix-2 DIF(decimation-in-frequency) butterfly diagram. 
The implementation is based on the Cooley-Tukey algorithm which is the most most used FFT algorithm To better understand this algorithm refer to link.
