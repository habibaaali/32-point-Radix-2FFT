# 32-point-Radix-2FFT
This is a 32 point pipelined Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) design used in OFDM system. 
The design is based on Radix-2 DIF(decimation-in-frequency) butterfly diagram.

## Background
The used algorithm is the Cooley-Tukey algorithm which is the most used FFT algorithm.
to better understand this algorithm please refer to [This link](https://pages.github.com/). 

## Design details
